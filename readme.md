## 🌟 **Project Overview**

This project investigates:
- The historical trends of greenhouse gas emissions across UK sectors.
- The application of **linear regression models** to predict future emissions.
- Key insights for achieving the UK's climate goals.

---

## 📊 **Key Findings**

### Trends
- **Decline in emissions**: Most sectors show a consistent decline in GHG emissions.
- **Transport and Retail Sectors**: Exhibit increasing emissions trends.

### Modeling Outcomes
- **Strong Fit**: Sectors like Manufacturing, Mining, and Public Administration exhibit excellent linear regression fits (R² > 0.8).
- **Challenges**: Transport and Consumer Expenditure require advanced modeling techniques.

---

## 🚀 **Features**

- **Sectoral Analysis**: Insights into how each sector contributes to GHG emissions.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Projections using linear regression for informed decision-making.
- **Visualization**: Interactive plots for deeper understanding of trends.

## 🎯 **Future Work**

- Exploring non-linear models like time-series and machine learning.
- Regional-level analysis for targeted interventions.
- Sector interdependency studies (e.g., energy's impact on transport emissions).
