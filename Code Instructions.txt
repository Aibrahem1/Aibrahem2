Data Wrangling instructions: 

This R script processes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data from an Excel file, organizes it into a clean format, and prepares it for analysis and visualization. Follow these steps to execute the script:

Prerequisites

1. Install the required R libraries:
   install.packages(c("readr", "janitor", "readxl", "dplyr", "tidyr"))

2. Ensure the dataset GHG_rawdata.xlsx is located in your working directory.

Steps to Run the Script

1. Set the Working Directory
   Replace ~/Rdirectory with the path to your working directory:
   setwd("~/Rdirectory")

2. Load and Prepare the Data
   The script reads data from different sheets in the Excel file, cleans it, and combines it into a single dataset.

3. Analyze and Explore the Data
   Use the following commands to explore the dataset:
   View(all_gases_emission)
   str(all_gases_emission)

4. Subset and Aggregate Data
   Data is grouped by sectors and gas types for analysis. Key datasets created include:
   - Consumer_data_long: Consumer expenditure data.
   - sector_data: Emissions data by sectors.
   - top10ghg: Top 10 sectors contributing to emissions.

5. Generate Visualizations
   Example: Generate a stacked area chart using the top10ghg dataset.

6. Clean Up
   Temporary datasets are removed to optimize memory:
   rm(GHG_filtered, other_sectors_row)

Additional Notes

- Use view() to inspect datasets.
- Export datasets for further exploration:
   write.csv(top10ghg, "top10ghg.csv", row.names = FALSE)

Analysis Instructions: 

### Instructions for Data Exploratory and Analysis
1. Setting Up Training and Test Data
- Split the dataset into training and test datasets.
- Normalize the emissions data by converting it into million tonnes for better readability.

2. Descriptive Statistics for Each Sector
- Calculate summary statistics (minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation) for emissions data grouped by sectors.
- Save the summarized statistics into a CSV file for further reference.

3. Exploring Linear Relationships
- Use scatterplots to visualize the relationship between year and emissions for each sector.
- Overlay linear regression trend lines on the scatterplots to identify trends over time.

4. Correlation Testing
- Calculate the correlation between year and emissions for each sector to assess the strength of linear relationships.
- Save the correlation results into a CSV file.

5. Fitting Linear Regression Models
- Fit linear regression models for each sector using year as the predictor and emissions as the response variable.
- Extract residuals and coefficients (intercept and slope) from the models and save them into CSV files.

6. Evaluating Model Performance
- Compute model performance metrics such as R-squared values for each sector to evaluate the fit of the regression models.
- Save these evaluation metrics into a CSV file for detailed analysis.

7. Making Predictions
- Use the linear regression models to predict future emissions for each sector up to the year 2050.
- Combine historical and predicted emissions data for comparison and visualization.

8. Visualizing Results
- Create visualizations to compare historical and projected emissions data.
- Use stacked area charts to show contributions of different sectors to total emissions over time.
- Highlight significant trends and annotate important milestones like the transition from historical to projected data.

9. Model Evaluation and Refinement
- Evaluate model predictions using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
- Identify strong, moderate, and weak sectors based on the modelâ€™s performance metrics.

These instructions will help you conduct a comprehensive analysis of greenhouse gas emissions data, evaluate sectoral contributions, and project future trends.
